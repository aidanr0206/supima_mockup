      "Only giving a four star because there were quite a few hiccups in the repair of my Dell XPS laptop, but what I really appreciated was the fact that the team took ownership of the issues and helped me at no further cost until the issues were rectified, which is so rare these days. The team has a lovely approach to customer service and was overall very efficient and helpful. Thanks so much Frans and Rose.",

      "Had a problem with my printer and came across the Supima team online. I can honestly say that John (the director) really went the extra mile to find a workable and affordable solution to resolve the issue with the printer. I am extremely happy with the result and even happier with the level of service received from the whole Suprima team. Thank you and keep it up!",

      "The level of service that I received from Brandon for the repair of my computer was above and beyond I would ever have expected.  I now need to purchase a new computer for a new employee and there is no other company that I would want to talk to.  Thank you so much Brandon.  You are amazing.",
